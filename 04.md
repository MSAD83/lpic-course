This file was made it for session four :

if you want to make a file inside of one path you need to tell it like this :
```
/bin/mkdir  test ---> for example inside of bin path you made test file
```
`which` it means where is my path
`whereis` shows all the related directories

FILES TYPE:
```
-    regular files(pdf,txt,jpg,...)
d    directories
l    symbolic link(shortcut)
s    socket
p    pipe
c    special device, character
b    special device, block
```

`man` the command that shows information and it means manual

`cd -` going to previous file 

absolute address is :
```
cd ./.. 
. = currently directory that you are 
.. = parent directory
```
related address is: 
```
cd .. ---> your parrent directory   
```
if you want to make a directory in this address :/root/1400/tir/ali
you can do it in two ways: 
absolute way:
```
mkdir /root/1400
mkdir /root/1400/tir
mkdir /root/1400/tir/ali
```
or related way : 
```
cd /root
mkdir ./1400
cd 1400
mkdir tir
...
```

```
echo $? == 0 : correct
echo $? != 0 : incorrect
```
```
echo $PATH
```
```
info = man (With some differences in structure)
```

```
word search in man -----> /word + enter (n & N To move)
```

```
-l -----> The first letter of the line indicates the file type.
