Some example of editing permisions:
![alt text](assets/image12.png)

With command of `stat + file name ` you can see the file history

For making a group you can use `groupadd` command line

`umask` if you call it show you how much did we reduce the 0666 for files and how much did we resucw from dir 0777 to give the default permisions.

Links:
1- hard link (link)
2- symbolic link (sym link)

To make sym link:

```
ln -s file_asli link_name
```

doesn't have data inside the link.
permision to links of sym link is 777.
we can make a chain link of sym links and if one of them disconnect the chain is broken

If you want to your link work only in a specific way you have to give the link absolute path , o.w. your link goona work in same name in other path!
